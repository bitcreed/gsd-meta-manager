## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.2]: Tech debt first to prevent archive browser from needing deleted ScreenAction variants
- [v1.2]: No new Cargo dependencies for v1.2 (except potentially pulldown-cmark for archive markdown styling)
- [v1.2]: Archive browser uses existing ListState pattern (not tui-tree-widget)
- [v1.2]: HANDOFF.json requires content check (not existence-only) to avoid stale badges
- [Phase 11]: HANDOFF file detection with non-empty content validation for pause badges
- [Phase 12]: Archive module in separate src/archive.rs file (not in detail.rs) for testability
- [Phase 12]: Abbreviated tab labels (5:Pipe, 7:Sess) to fit 8 tabs within 80 columns
- [Phase 13]: Strategy A (per-item isolated execution) recommended for v1.3 queue execution
- [Phase 13]: LLM-agnostic Executor trait interface for queue execution backends

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Tab bar overflow at 80 columns when adding 8th tab (Archive) -- resolve at Phase 12 design time
